ZPass2 is password generator that solves the problem of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for all kinds of sites and applications.

Motivation
---
People rely more then ever on their digital docs and online presence.
Huge amount of private data is stored on online services that use passwords to authenticate their users.
The need for strong password to keep this services safe from brute-force attacks has grow with the increase of computation power that is available to the attacker.
Requiring users to invent different complex passwords for each service they use and memorize them is a usability issue and an hassle to the user.
ZPass2 makes it easy to create strong passwords without the need for the user to remember more then one strong password.
